* Stopped displaying an error message when trying to start a container that is already started.
* Improved error messages reported to the user in the case of finding an empty string.
* Switched to using the dockerode pull progress mechanism.
* Fixed trying to delete supervisor container when it reports an alternate tag instead of the primary tag.
